# Build the code and the tests:
I have created `Makefile` and to run tests run command `make build` or `./mvnw verify -P jacoco` from main directory of the project.
Then after build is finished you can open jacoco report from `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Files:

You can find sonar report in directory:
`src/main/resources/sonar/sonar.png`

And UML:
`src/main/resources/diagrams/UML.png`
